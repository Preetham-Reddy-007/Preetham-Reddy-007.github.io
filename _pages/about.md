Welcome to my webpage! I'm Preetham Reddy Goudelly, a passionate engineer dedicated to advancing energy efficiency, hardware-software co-optimization, and machine learning computation efficiency. With a Master's in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University and a Bachelor's from Ramaiah Institute of Technology, my journey has been fueled by curiosity and an unwavering commitment to innovation.
I specialize in FPGA prototyping and have developed strong programming skills in SystemVerilog, C++, and Python. My approach combines skill and knowledge to create cutting-edge solutions. At Samsung R&D, I optimized neural network models for mobile devices, enhancing efficiency and user experience. My time as a Project Associate at the Indian Institute of Science allowed me to design protocol bridges and validate energy-efficient RISC-V cores.
My projects reflect my dedication to innovation. I've designed a Multi-DNN Accelerator using a hardware-software co-design approach, optimizing machine learning workloads on FPGA platforms. A "Jugaad" mindset drives each project I undertakeâ€”embracing creativity and resourcefulness to solve complex engineering challenges.
Thank you for visiting my page. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals passionate about technology and innovation!
